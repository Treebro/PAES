So, this is where the tree of dependacy starts.

Very top level in the scope of PAES
Health tree:
-Healthy body indefinitely sustainable
Safety tree:
-Removal of complications that can cause death at a reasonably high risk rate, like slipping in a shower awkwardly
Death tree:
-Re-influence people to accept that death is impossible to escape, even with eternal health, the universe has expiry date
Soul tree:
-Re-influence concept of soul.  Seriously your body is likely the only vassel for the soul that experiences reality.  Transfer or conversion is likely murder to the original hosts perspective soul.
Societal tree:
-Re-influence people to push for the wellbeing of others as well as push to have PAES succeed.  The demons of the world will likely need to be converted and accepted for their nature.  They'll fit later, as with a long enough timescale, anyone can become anything permittable by physics.
