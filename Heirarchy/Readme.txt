So, this is where the tree of dependacy starts.

<Very top level in the scope of PAES>
Health tree:
-Healthy body indefinitely sustainable.
Safety tree:
-Removal of complications that can cause death at a reasonably high risk rate, like slipping in a shower awkwardly.  If accidental destructions and age related destructions of people can be removed, it would simply be awesome.
Death tree:
-Re-influence people to accept that death is impossible to escape, even with eternal health, the universe has a hard set expiry date, like maybe if someone is smart enough to figure this out, it could also mean the universe is indefinite length as well but who knows, we won't know for a billion billion billion billion trillion years and even then we might not know for absolutely sure.
Soul tree:
-Re-influence concept of soul.  Seriously your body is likely the only vassel for the soul that experiences reality.  Transfer or conversion to another body is likely murder to the original hosts perspective soul.
Societal tree:
-Re-influence people to push for the wellbeing of others as well as push to have PAES succeed.  The metaphorical demons of the world will likely need to be converted and accepted for their nature.  They'll fit later, as with a long enough timescale, anyone can become anything permittable by physics. Egoistic Altruism is an ideal.
