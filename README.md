 Publically Accessible Eternity Sequencing.
 
 In more common words, immortality, except like, being human means you are still mortal.  Just hopefully uneffected by age after a desired and selectable amount of growth.
 
 I have both faith and an intense focus that this can be acheived solely through re-coding DNA, redefining what it is to be human, hopefully for the better but cross that bridge when it comes.

This project will primarily focus on wetware rather than software, any license attached should consider both as equivelents.  They are both structured by data stored in memory, binary base2(01) and DNA base4(TGAC) which can be represented simply by 2 bits.
