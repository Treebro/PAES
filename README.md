 Publically Accessible Eternity Sequencing.
 
 In more common words, immortality, except like, being human means you're still mortal.  Just hopefully unaffected by age after a desired amount of growth.
 
 I have both faith and an intense focus that this can be acheived solely through re-coding DNA, redefining what it is to be human, hopefully for the better but cross that bridge when it comes.
