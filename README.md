 Publically Accessible Eternity Sequencing.
 
In more common words, immortality, except like, being human means you are still mortal.  Just hopefully uneffected by age after a desired and selectable amount of growth.
 
I have both faith and an intense focus that this can be acheived solely through re-coding DNA, through creating new/improved cellular functions via carbon based nanomachines we commonly refer to as proteins.  Any other angles that become apparent when development proceeds should be leveraged as well.  This will redefine what it is to be human, hopefully for the better. Cross that bridge when it comes.

This project will primarily focus on wetware rather than software, any license attached should consider both as equivelents.  They are both structured by data stored in memory. Since each DNA nucleotide is base4 (TGAC) it can be stored in 2 bits per nucleotide.  Since the project will be stored in binary on servers, the saved genetic coding methods should be considered software directly. 

Would be nice to have an open source variant instead of just taking whatever a private group makes. Genetic modifications will be giving "admin privilege" to literally everything your soul experiences reality through, including your brain and future decision making functions.

Write/verify the source DNA you want to augment, do this with knowledge of every segment of the genetic code's function.

Triple check on 3 seperate verification measures that the code is precisely accurate.

Again, this is giving arbitrary code execution over your body.

Unlike a common virus that hijacks cells to produce more virus in a natural fashion, the changes here will be engineered to be incredibly potent in comparison.
