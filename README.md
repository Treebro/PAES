 Publically Accessible Eternity Sequencing.
 
 In more common words, immortality, except like, being human means you are still mortal.  Just hopefully uneffected by age after a desired and selectable amount of growth.
 
 I have both faith and an intense focus that this can be acheived solely through re-coding DNA, redefining what it is to be human, hopefully for the better but cross that bridge when it comes.

This project will primarily focus on wetware rather than software, any license attached should consider both as equivelents.  They are both structured by data stored in memory, binary base2(01) and DNA base4(TGAC) which can be represented simply by 2 bits. 

Would be nice to have an open source variant instead of just taking whatever private group makes and giving it admin rights to literally everything your soul experiences reality through.

Write/verify the source DNA you want to augment, do this with knowledge of every segment of code's function.

Triple check on 3 seperate verification measures that the code is precisely accurate.

Again, this is giving arbitrary code execution over your body.

Unlike a common virus that hijacks cells to produce more virus in a natural fashion, the changes here are engineered and will be engineered to be incredibly potent.
